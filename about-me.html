            <p>Hi my name Alexander James Becoy and I'm 18-year old. I'm a student who's going to start studying Computer Science. I do quite varied things for fun such as; building website, making 2d sprites, developing and designing games, sometimes play and create music and mostly programming stuffs.</p>
            <p>I've started creating sprites and games when I was 12-year old. Aspired to become a game developer. But that dream started to fade away once I saw other kinds of jobs and how hard it is to find a job in game development, but I digress. Because I was still technically a child back then, I didn't know the consequences and kept losing my previous arts and WIPs by losing computers. I didn't know I could save my work in the cloud or perhaps I did, but was too lazy to do so. I could only save a fraction of my previous work. School was getting rough too, I really didn't have the time to work on making games and/or creating resources.</p>
            <p>Now I've finally finished my high school, have a long-ass summer vacation and learnt new knowledges and techniques that I could use for making art and creating video games.</p>
